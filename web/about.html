            A "mash-up" between Google Maps and the TFL London Underground Arrival boards.
            The Arrival boards are scanned and the resuls translated in to Map coordinates
            and plotted on the map.

            Extreme care is taken to minimise the amount of requests made to the TFL Web site.
            Train location are only ever updated <b>once per minute</b> and the results cached
            and stored for future requests. A number of optimizing algorithms also enusre the
            minial amount of requests are ever made, and no requests are made if no users are
            on the site.
